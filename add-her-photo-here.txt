How to Add Photos to Your Birthday Surprise:

1. MAIN PROFILE PHOTO:
   Choose a beautiful photo of your girlfriend (preferably in square format)
   Save it as "her-photo.jpg" or "her-photo.png" in this folder
   Update the CSS in styles.css:

   Find this section:
   
   .her-photo {
       width: 100%;
       height: 100%;
       background-color: #ffd1dc; /* Placeholder pink color */
       background-image: url('https://via.placeholder.com/300x300'); /* Replace with actual photo URL */
       background-size: cover;
       background-position: center;
       transform: scale(0.9);
       opacity: 0.8;
       animation: photoZoom 10s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
   }

   And change it to:
   
   .her-photo {
       width: 100%;
       height: 100%;
       background-color: #ffd1dc; /* Placeholder pink color */
       background-image: url('her-photo.jpg'); /* Or her-photo.png - match your file name */
       background-size: cover;
       background-position: center;
       transform: scale(0.9);
       opacity: 0.8;
       animation: photoZoom 10s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
   }

2. FLOATING POLAROID IMAGES:
   Add 4 additional photos of you two together (they should be square format)
   Save them as "photo1.jpg", "photo2.jpg", "photo3.jpg", and "photo4.jpg" in this folder
   Update the HTML in index.html:

   Find each polaroid image section and update it:
   
   <div class="polaroid-image" style="background-image: url('https://via.placeholder.com/150x150/ffd1dc?text=Photo+1')"></div>
   
   Change to:
   
   <div class="polaroid-image" style="background-image: url('photo1.jpg')"></div>
   
   Repeat for all 4 polaroid images, using the appropriate photo file name for each.
   You can also update the captions to match the memories in the photos.

3. FLASHBACK MEMORIES:
   Add 5 more photos for the flashback memories (can be any size but square or 4:3 ratio works best)
   Save them as "memory1.jpg", "memory2.jpg", "memory3.jpg", "memory4.jpg", and "memory5.jpg"
   Update the HTML in index.html:

   Find each flashback image section and update it:
   
   <div class="flashback-image" style="background-image: url('https://via.placeholder.com/400x400/ffd1dc?text=Memory+1')"></div>
   
   Change to:
   
   <div class="flashback-image" style="background-image: url('memory1.jpg')"></div>
   
   Repeat for all 5 memory images.
